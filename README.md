# Project--R-17

<table>
Usually when dealing with an unsupervised learning problem, its difficult to get a good measure of how well the model performed.<br></<br>
  
**In this project, we will use data from the UCI archive based off of red and white wines (this is a very commonly used data set in ML)**.<br></br>
The sets contain physicochemical properties of red and white Vinho Verdes wines and their respective sensory qualities as assessed by wine experts.<br></br>
The set includes samples of 1599 different red and 4898 white wines regarding the following attributes:

**Atrribute**	       **Unit**	    **Description**<br>
Fixed Acidity	    g/L	    Concentration of non-volatile tartaric acid in the wine.<br></br>
Volatile Acidity  g/L	    Concentration of volatile acetic acid in the wine.<br></br>
Citric Acid	      g/L	    Concentration of citric acid in the wine.<br></br>
Residual Sugar	  g/L	    Concentration of sugar remaining after the fermentation in the wine.<br></br>
Chlorides	        g/L	    Concentration of sodium chloride in the wine.<br></br>
Free Sulfur Dioxide	mg/L	Concentration of free, gaseous sulfur dioxide in the wine.<br></br>
Total Sulfur Dioxide	mg/L Total concentration of sulfur dioxide in the wine.<br></br>
Density	            g/cm3	 Density of the wine.<br></br>
pH	          1   - 14	   Acidity of the wine.<br></br>
Sulphates	    g/L	        Concentration of potassium sulfate in the wine.<br></br>
Alcohol	      vol%	      Alcohol content of the wine.<br></br>
Quality	     1 - 10	      Wine quality score as assessed by experts.<br></br>
